# 79NG-boxmodel
Box model of the subglacial plume at the 79° North Glacier in Greenland

We present a zero-dimensional model of the subglacial plume under the floating ice tongue of the 79° North Glacier (79NG) in Northeast Greenland.
This box model was implemented by Otis Hoffmann as part of a bachelor's thesis at the University of Rostock (2021).
It is based on the model by Olbers & Hellmer (2010), using parametrizations by Burchard _et al._ (2022) and Jenkins (2011).

You can find an interactive demo of the model by following the link below and opening the file BoxModel.ipynb:
